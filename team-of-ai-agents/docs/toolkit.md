# Toolkit Documentation

Welcome to the toolkit documentation! In this document, we'll walk you through what a toolkit is, its components, how it ties with agents, and how it can be leveraged by a team of agents.

## What is a Toolkit?

A toolkit is a collection of tools designed to perform specific functions or tasks. In the context of our system, a toolkit encompasses a set of related tools, typically grouped by their functionality or the source/platform they interact with. Each toolkit is identified by a unique ID and can be enabled or disabled, allowing users to manage which tools are actively available for their agents.


## How Toolkits Relate to Agents

**Agents** are the primary entities that interact with toolkits. Think of agents as automated workers that utilize the tools provided by the toolkits to carry out tasks or functions. When setting up an agent, you'll associate it with one or more toolkits, granting the agent the ability to use the tools contained within those toolkits.

For example, if an agent is set up to perform web searches, it might be associated with the "Google SERP Search Toolkit," allowing it to use the "Serp Google Search" tool.

## Leveraging Toolkits in a Team

In a team of agents, each agent might have different roles or responsibilities. By strategically associating agents with specific toolkits, teams can ensure that each agent has the tools necessary for its designated function.

For example, an agent responsible for weather updates might be linked to the "OpenWeatherMap Toolkit," while another agent handling social media updates might utilize the "Twitter Toolkit" or "Instagram Toolkit."

This modular approach allows for flexibility, scalability, and the ability to quickly adapt to new requirements or functionalities. Team members can easily onboard new agents, equip them with the necessary toolkits, and have them operational in no time.


## Conclusion

The toolkit system offers a structured and modular approach to equip agents with the functionalities they need. By understanding the components of a toolkit and how it ties into agents, users can effectively manage, scale, and adapt to ever-evolving requirements.
