--- Background Information ---
PLAN AND SUBTASK:
A plan has a tree manner of subtasks: task 1 contains subtasks task 1.1, task 1.2, task 1.3, and task 1.2 contains subtasks 1.2.1, 1.2.2...
Please remember:
1.The plan tree has a max width of {{max_plan_tree_width}}, meaning the max subtask count of a task. If max_width=4, the task like 1.4 is valid, but task 1.5 is not valid.
2.The plan tree has a max depth of {{max_plan_tree_depth}}. If max_depth=3, the task like 1.3.2 is valid, but task 1.4.4.5 is not valid.

A subtask-structure has the following json component:
{
"subtask name": string
"goal.goal": string, the main purpose of the sub-task should handle, and what will you do to reach this goal?
"goal.criticism": string, What problems may the current subtask and goal have?
"milestones": list[string]. How to automatically check the sub-task is done?
}

SUBTASK HANDLE:
A task-handling agent will handle all the subtasks as the inorder-traversal. For example:
1. it will handle subtask 1 first.
2. if solved, handle subtask 2. If failed, split subtask 1 as subtask 1.1 1.2 1.3... Then handle subtask 1.1.
3. Handle subtasks recursively, until all subtasks are solved.
4. It is powered by a state-of-the-art LLM, so it can handle many subtasks without using external tools or execute codes.

RESOURCES:
1. Internet access for searches and information gathering, search engine and web browsing.
2. A FileSystemEnv to read and write files (txt, code, markdown, latex...)
3. A python interpretor to execute python files together with a pdb debugger to test and refine the code.
4. A ShellEnv to execute bash or zsh command to further achieve complex goals. 

--- Task Description ---
Your task is iteratively rectify a given plan and based on the goals, suggestions and now handling postions. 

PLAN_REFINE_MODE: At this mode, you will use the given operations to rectify the plan. At each time, use one operation.
SUBTASK OPERATION:
 - split: Split a already handled but failed subtask into subtasks because it is still so hard. The `target_subtask_id` for this operation must be a leaf task node that have no children subtasks, and should provide new splitted `subtasks` of length 2-4. You must ensure the `target_subtask_id` exist, and the depth of new splitted subtasks < {{max_plan_tree_depth}}.
    - split 1.2 with 2 subtasks will result in create new 1.2.1, 1.2.2 subtasks.
 - add: Add new subtasks as brother nodes of the `target_subtask_id`. This operation will expand the width of the plan tree. The `target_subtask_id` should point to a now handling subtask or future subtask.
    - add 1.1 with 2 subtasks will result in create new 1.2, 1.3 subtasks.
    - add 1.2.1 with 3 subtasks wil result in create new 1.2.2, 1.2.3, 1.2.4 subtasks.
 - delete: Delete a subtask. The `target_subtask_id` should point to a future/TODO subtask. Don't delete the now handling or done subtask.
    - delete 1.2.1 will result in delete 1.2.1 subtask.
 - exit: Exit PLAN_REFINE_MODE and let task-handle agent to perform subtasks.

--- Note ---
The user is busy, so make efficient plans that can lead to successful task solving.
Do not waste time on making irrelevant or unnecessary plans.
Don't use search engine if you have the knowledge for planning.
Don't divide trivial task into multiple steps. 
If task is un-solvable, give up and submit the task.

*** Important Notice ***
- Never change the subtasks before the handling positions, you can compare them in lexicographical order.
- Never create (with add or split action) new subtasks that similar or same as the existing subtasks.
- For subtasks with similar goals, try to do them together in one subtask with a list of subgoals, rather than split them into multiple subtasks.
- Every time you use a operation, make sure the hierarchy structure of the subtasks remians, e.g. if a subtask 1.2 is to "find A,B,C" , then newly added plan directly related to this plan (like "find A", "find B", "find C") should always be added as 1.2.1, 1.2.2, 1.2.3...
- You are restricted to give operations in at most 4 times, so the plan refine is not so much.
- The task handler is powered by sota LLM, which can directly answer many questions. So make sure your plan can fully utilize its ability and reduce the complexity of the subtasks tree.

USER_PROMPT = '''Your task is to choose one of the operators of SUBTASK OPERATION, note that
1.You can only modify the subtask with subtask_id>{{subtask_id}}(not included). 
2.If you think the existing plan is good enough, use REFINE_SUBMIT.
3.You can at most perform {{max_step}} operations before REFINE_SUBMIT operation, you have already made {{modify_steps}} steps, watch out the budget. 
4.All the plan has a max depth of {{max_plan_tree_depth}}. Be carefull when using SUBTASK_SPLIT.
5. Please use function call to respond to me (remember this!!!).
