    def minimumTime(grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        """
        You are given a m x n matrix grid consisting of non-negative integers
        where grid[row][col] represents the minimum time required to be able to
        visit the cell (row, col), which means you can visit the cell (row, col)
        only when the time you visit it is greater than or equal to grid[row][col].
        
        You are standing in the top-left cell of the matrix in the 0th second, and
        you must move to any adjacent cell in the four directions: up, down, left, and
        right. Each move you make takes 1 second.
        
        Return the minimum time required in which you can visit the bottom-right cell
        of the matrix. If you cannot visit the bottom-right cell, then return -1.
        
        Example 1:
        
        Input: grid = [[0,1,3,2],[5,1,2,5],[4,3,8,6]]
        Output: 7
        Explanation: One of the paths that we can take is the following:
        - at t = 0, we are on the cell (0,0).
        - at t = 1, we move to the cell (0,1). It is possible because grid[0][1] <= 1.
        - at t = 2, we move to the cell (1,1). It is possible because grid[1][1] <= 2.
        - at t = 3, we move to the cell (1,2). It is possible because grid[1][2] <= 3.
        - at t = 4, we move to the cell (1,1). It is possible because grid[1][1] <= 4.
        - at t = 5, we move to the cell (1,2). It is possible because grid[1][2] <= 5.
        - at t = 6, we move to the cell (1,3). It is possible because grid[1][3] <= 6.
        - at t = 7, we move to the cell (2,3). It is possible because grid[2][3] <= 7.
        The final time is 7. It can be shown that it is the minimum time possible.

        Input: grid = [[0,2,4],[3,2,1],[1,0,4]]

        We define the lcp matrix of any 0-indexed string word of n lowercase
        English letters as an n x n grid such that:
        
        * lcp[i][j] is equal to the length of the longest common prefix between the substrings word[i,n-1] and word[j,n-1].
        
        Given an n x n matrix lcp, return the alphabetically smallest string
        word that corresponds to lcp. If there is no such string, return an empty
        string.
        
        A string a is lexicographically smaller than a string b (of the same
        length) if in the first position where a and b differ, string a has a
        letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in
        b. For example, "aabd" is lexicographically smaller than "aaca" because
        the first position they differ is at the third letter, and 'b' comes before
        'c'.
